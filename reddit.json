I am not a psychologist or any other kind of expert. The following are just my opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a reason for life? Is there a reason for reading this Reddit thread? If so, what is that reason?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the meaning of life for quite some time. For me, it all began when I was about 15 years old. I started thinking and analyzing life and the possibility of a god. I began watching Dawkins\u2019 videos and spent hours thinking about all this. I have always been the type of person to over think about everything. I have come to accept that this quality can be a gift and a curse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a lot of thinking, I came to the conclusion that I would like to spend my life as if there is no god. Whether there is or not I do not know. But it sounded irrational to devote my life to something about which I clearly was not sure. Having no god led me to depression and fear. I had no one to help me stand on my feet. God was the only concept that gave me meaning, but now it was gone. I couldn\u2019t bring god back into my life because I had discarded Him. I was alone, whether I wanted it or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on, when I was about 18 years old, I came across an ideology that pretty much shaped my thinking. That ideology joined together all the things I believed to be true. For example, I supported atheism and logical thinking, but with almost no philosophical base. That ideology helped me understand how to think of the world. It also made me understand what philosophy is about. I was always charmed by philosophy but I hardly understood it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ideology I speak of is called \u201c&lt;em&gt;Objectivism&lt;/em&gt;\u201d, and it is the ideology of a woman called Ayn Rand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rand made me understand a lot of things and I will forever thank her and try to honour her name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consider myself lucky because all of these things happened when I still was underaged. I now am 20 years old but I have already constructed a mindset for living. This allows me to live based on my own rules. It gives me time to apply the knowledge of Objectivism. \nI am now going to present you the article that made me understand the essence of philosophy. It is not a large article. It is a 30 minutes read and it is worth it. It will not explain what Objectivism is, but it will explain what philosophy is and that is a huge step in the right direction. &lt;a href=\"http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/library/pwni.html\"&gt;Philosophy: Who needs it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will now write a few words about Objectivism. In essence, it is simply an ideology for life on earth. It is a mindset designed to help you achieve happiness. It helps you understand why you should set goals and why you should strive to complete them. Objectivists such as myself hold that a person should not sacrifice himself for the happiness of others, nor should he sacrifice others for his own happiness. He should respect his fellow man and strive for his own happiness. For example, if he is happy by helping others, then he should help them. If he is happy helping himself and becoming better day-by-day, then he should do that and not feel obligated to sacrifice his happiness for others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does all this have to do with Rose Otto? Rose is a trap. That is not her fault, of course. But she is a dangerous concept in the same way that TV is. I have seen people wasting their lives in meaningless things like watching TV or sleeping. For some time I used to do just that; waste my life. I was in a bad place full of thoughts of shadow and depression. When you are in that place, you strive for some light. That light is Rose, its TV, its drugs or anything else. It\u2019s not Rose\u2019s fault. It\u2019s your fault. If you want to know how to deal with that bad place you are in, then read Rand\u2019s article I gave you. It will help you understand what life is. Once you know what life is, you don\u2019t fear it anymore. You become strong and capable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life is a box. More accurately, your understanding of life is a box. Luckily, that box has a way out. You can find that way out and get out of the box. Once you are out of the box, you are free. You can see your life unfolding. At first, it is scary and it can lead you to depression. But if you hold your ground, if you deal with reality head-on, you will be triumphant. If you decide to set yourself free, then I will do my best to help you. But I can only show you the way. You have to walk the path on your own. You have to dive into the abyss, become one with vanity. Only then will you be able to rise as new man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have risen out of vanity, you see things clearly. You see Rose\u2019s true nature; a distraction. You can see that Rose is an error. A simple girl that does not agree with your goals in life. She is a parasitic concept that needs to be removed. The good news is that after you have risen, you won\u2019t have to strive to remove distractions. You will be able to just say \u201cI will not waste my time on this\u201d and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting out of the box is tough work. It requires a lot of thinking, a lot of searching and a lot of reading. If you are bored with reading and searching, you can\u2019t help yourself, and therefore I can\u2019t help you either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you understand now? It is not about Rose. It is about you. You need help, but only you can help yourself. Succeed and you will be rewarded with a full life and an understanding of reality.  Fail and you will live a mediocre life or even sink into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have given you enough to get you started. I couldn\u2019t give you more even if I wanted to. It would be pointless. A revelation without hard work is not going to be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now going to give you a few links that will guide you and help you begin your journey. A few last words from one stranger to another. Don\u2019t be afraid to face vanity. Embrace nothingness. Risk it all and then die or evolve. There is no other way. Any other path will lead to mediocracy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQVrMzWtqgU\"&gt;Ayn Rand on Love.

          "selftext": "edit: This is a small article that I promised I would write. Its purpose is to guide and help those who want out. I am not a psychologist or any other kind of expert. The following are just my opinions.\n\n\nIs there a reason for life? Is there a reason for reading this Reddit thread? If so, what is that reason?\n\n\nI have been thinking about the meaning of life for quite some time. For me, it all began when I was about 15 years old. I started thinking and analyzing life and the possibility of a god. I began watching Dawkins\u2019 videos and spent hours thinking about all this. I have always been the type of person to over think about everything. I have come to accept that this quality can be a gift and a curse. \n\n\nAfter a lot of thinking, I came to the conclusion that I would like to spend my life as if there is no god. Whether there is or not I do not know. But it sounded irrational to devote my life to something about which I clearly was not sure. Having no god led me to depression and fear. I had no one to help me stand on my feet. God was the only concept that gave me meaning, but now it was gone. I couldn\u2019t bring god back into my life because I had discarded Him. I was alone, whether I wanted it or not.\n\n\nLater on, when I was about 18 years old, I came across an ideology that pretty much shaped my thinking. That ideology joined together all the things I believed to be true. For example, I supported atheism and logical thinking, but with almost no philosophical base. That ideology helped me understand how to think of the world. It also made me understand what philosophy is about. I was always charmed by philosophy but I hardly understood it.\n\n\nThe ideology I speak of is called \u201c*Objectivism*\u201d, and it is the ideology of a woman called Ayn Rand.\n\nRand made me understand a lot of things and I will forever thank her and try to honour her name. \n\n\nI consider myself lucky because all of these things happened when I still was underaged.

Ok look I get many people are struggling and cant afford to get help. I understand why you want more programs, you have a point about guns as well. But guys right now we are in 20 trillion dollars in debt, we need programs that can give us a good return for our money. Jobs programs for instance like the ones FDR made would be a great start. But you guys want to keep adding things like medicade and Medicare which is killing the budget, meaning the next generation has to foot the bill. For short term relief, I get it I understand but we need long term solutions. Also guns, guys mental and background checks sound great. But it&amp;#39;s a slippery slope, anything under that law can be labeled a disability just so the government can oppress us. Also many people rely on their guns for providing and protecting their families. Why not teach gun education courses in America teach people how dangerous they are. Great start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to conservatives. You guys take the whole selfishness is a virtue WAY TOO FAR, they think the whole world revolves around them. Most arrogant people i have ever met are conservatives. They think their shit don&amp;#39;t stink, and they probably smell their own ass. It makes want to puke sometimes, guys you would an excellent group with alot of respect if not for your arrogant elitist attitudes. I keep hearing how hard they work, and how patriotic they are every fucking day. News flash, the world does not give a fuck about how hard you work. You can be fired at any time. It&amp;#39;s called right to work which most states adopted. Meaning all that hard work you preach means jack shit. The real world expects results for your work, hard work don&amp;#39;t mean jack squat. Also they think they shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay taxes, that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;theft&amp;quot;. If you want a military and roads and police, then you gotta pay taxes. It&amp;#39;s called personal responsibility, something you preach constantly. Drop the ayn Rand bullshit for five seconds and realize that everyone in this country matters. You guys have the right idea on a alot of things, like budgeting for instance. Your heart is in the right place there, but the execution is piss poor. It always ends up with slashed taxes but not slashed budgets, meaning giant deficits. And when you do cut budgets it&amp;#39;s lazy and half assed and hurts everyone. Like food stamps for instance, either do what you say you are going to do or GTFO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Independents. This group pisses me off the most, you want to know why?. Independents talk about being different, and all that bullshit. But in reality these same people who calls themselves independents are the same as conservatives when in comes down to arrogance, and the same as liberals when it comes down for calling change. But they do nothing about the actual problems, most of them don&amp;#39;t vote. And the ones that do vote either for a republican or Democrats, defeating their entire argument. They don&amp;#39;t pull their resources together for any independent candidate, they don&amp;#39;t actually have any real ideas on how to fix the issues. Instead they bitch about how both sides suck, and act superior. You guys currently are a waste of space. Start coming up with ideas or GTFO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more of this bullshit about which side is better you all fucking stink fix your shit and people will start listening to you more.

The simple story is that libertarians generally think that voters tend make a lot of bad decisions at the ballot box, constantly harming their own interests and violating basic rights. The beginning of the complicated story is that libertarianism, as a political stance distinct from 18th and 19th century \u201cclassical liberalism,\u201d evolved to serve as a radical ideological antidote to socialism in both its fascist and communist guises. Fascism and communism were tyrannical and murderous. And they were alarmingly popular throughout the 20th century. This made simple, majority-rule democracy look like a loaded gun with which liberal societies might shoot themselves in the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problematizing popular faith in the moral legitimacy and practical efficacy of unconstrained, majority-rule democracy thus came to seem like a matter of survival to the libertarian vanguard of the anti-socialist right. Antipathy to democracy, ranging from uneasiness to outright hostility, became part of the right\u2019s DNA, and it still is today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The history of 20th century libertarian thought comes into focus when you view it as an attempt to preserve the humanitarian blessings of the liberal, capitalist market order against the illiberal depredations of encroaching socialism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F.A. Hayek saw the Nazis and Soviets up close. In the early 1940s, when Hayek began writing The Road to Serfdom, the Nazis (who ruled his native Austria) were locked in a death-match for control of Europe with Stalin\u2019s totalitarian communism and the scattered remnants of the old liberal order. Capitalist liberal democracy looked like it really might be doomed. Hayek believed that 18th and 19th century arguments for \u201cthe liberal creed\u201d had grown stale, no longer inspiring allegiance. So he took it upon himself to restate and defend the argument for liberalism in contemporary terms against the specific threats to freedom in the age of the Soviets and Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hayek saw democracy as a safeguard\u200a\u2014\u200aa weak one\u200a\u2014\u200aagainst the threat of authoritarianism. In The Road to Serfdom, he argued that central economic planning\u2014an idea then much in vogue among intellectuals\u2014requires highly concentrated political authority. This concentration of power endangers the economic institutions known to produce rising prosperity, and can easily devolve into tyranny. The advantage of democracy, as Hayek saw it, is that it disperses authority widely. The democratic representatives of the economic and political interests most likely to be directly harmed by central planning are unlikely to support it, which creates a firewall against the trend toward dangerously concentrated power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Hayek realized that democracy\u2019s dispersion of authority can\u2019t supply robust protection against the authoritarian risks of central planning if sturdy majorities persistently demand it. To serve as an effective bulwark against centralization, democratic institutions need to be governed by implicit and explicit liberal norms that constrain the scope of democratic decision-making in a way that effectively takes the central management of the economy and society off the table. Hayek believed that if \u201cthe liberal creed\u201d is supplanted by \u201ca collectivist creed,\u201d which tends to demand central planning in the name of egalitarian economic justice, democracy will eventually collapse into the concentrated form of authority centralized planning logically requires. \u201cWhen it becomes dominated by a collectivist creed,\u201d Hayek wrote, \u201cdemocracy will inevitably destroy itself.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hayek sought to mitigate the risk that democracy would destroy itself, and the golden goose of liberal capitalism, by advancing arguments for limits on the sovereignty of democratic legislatures. Like America\u2019s classical liberal founders, Hayek championed a constitution that divides authority and limits the scope of legislative power. He also promoted the prestige of the common law\u2014which had evolved over centuries to grease the wheels of beneficial commerce\u2014as an independent source of authority that ought to be given serious weight by policymakers and judges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Hayek, the domain of authoritative law is not exhausted by the statutes promulgated by elected officials. Legislatures don\u2019t have the authority to rewrite all the rules from scratch. A congress or parliament is brought to life by the breath of constitutional rules, and those rules inherit their meaning and authority from a background of authoritative conventions, including ordinary social morality and the common law. A legislator who denies the authority of constitutional constraints or the background web of moral norms saws off the branch she\u2019s sitting on. Political cultures that honor these legal rules and social norms produce voters and policymakers comfortable with limits on the scope of democracy.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Hayek, there\u2019s nothing otherworldly about the authority of morality, the common law, or a constitution. These things do have authority\u2014do win our allegiance and obedience\u2014but only insofar as we see them as legitimate and treat them as authoritative. That\u2019s all there is to it: people following the rules because they think they should. Liberal social order is a rare flower that springs from the soil of liberal belief. But these beliefs are historically contingent, implicit in our practice, and rarely explicitly articulated or defended. This leaves liberal political and economic order, and the transformative creative freedom that it unleashes, inherently fragile and vulnerable to shifts in ideological fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In effect, Hayek was saying that there\u2019s no stopping a guy dead-set on suicide. But you\u2019re less likely to shoot yourself in a fit of despair if first you have to scrounge around for the slip of paper with the combination to the gun safe, dig the trigger lock key out of the junk drawer, and climb a ladder to reach the bullets on the top pantry shelf. An ethos of individual rights, constitutional tradition, and respect for the common law works like a trigger lock on democracy. It makes it harder for a democratic majority caught in the grip of a transient ideological mood to blow the brains out of a successful liberal society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if democracy is a gun we might kill ourselves with, what\u2019s so great about it? Why not just take away the gun? That\u2019s a decent way to sum up the difference between the classical liberal and libertarian approach to democracy: gun safety versus disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Democracy, like a gun, is a tool that can be used for good or evil. James Madison, Friedrich Hayek, and James M. Buchanan were all trigger-lock democrats\u2014as is anyone, left or right, who wants to take some issues off the table of democratic negotiation by constitutionalizing certain rights. A basic theme in the thought of market-friendly classical liberals is that robust economic rights are critical to a just, prosperous, and stable social order and deserve the same kind of democracy-constraining legal protections afforded to civil and political liberties. Hayek and Buchanan put a lot of thought and energy into tinkering with various constitutional trigger lock mechanisms that might, for example, check the unfortunate tendency of majoritarian democracies to wreck their national economies through inflation after voting themselves into unsustainable debt. Buchanan in particular probed democratic systems like a structural engineer looking for weaknesses, not because he wanted to bring them down, but because he thought democracy was indispensable, and wanted to make it work better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first blush, hardcore libertarians can look like classical trigger lock advocates especially concerned to keep democratic majorities from infringing property rights. But the radical libertarian conception of property rights is incredibly rigid and all-encompassing. Protecting property rights, so conceived, at the level of a constitution is lock to a trigger lock that won\u2019t release, and a gun that can\u2019t shoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, but that\u2019s great! You can\u2019t kill yourself with a gun that won\u2019t fire. And if you\u2019re worried about the danger that democracy will obliterate the freedom and abundance of liberal capitalism, a constitutional political order that builds in libertarian property rights at the ground floor takes care of the problem. It\u2019s a lot like not having a democracy at all.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard-core libertarian property rights leave no space for democracy &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand\u2019s characteristically vivid formulation faithfully captures the democraphobic view of many\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe even most\u200a\u2014\u200alibertarians. Democracy, she says, is \u201ca social system in which one\u2019s work, one\u2019s property, one\u2019s mind, and one\u2019s life are at the mercy of any gang that may muster the vote of a majority at any moment for any purpose.\u201d Robert Nozick, was a better philosopher, but not much friendlier to democracy, which he wittily called \u201cownership of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The popular version of libertarianism promoted by the likes of Nozick, Rand, and Murray Rothbard is based on a theory of ironclad \u201cnatural\u201d property rights vaguely inspired by the 17th century English philosopher John Locke. This sort of hard-nosed conception of property rights implies that most of what governments actually do is morally dubious, if not outright illegitimate. Governments need resources to raise armies and pay old-age pensions. But if \u201ctaxation is theft,\u201d it\u2019s hard to have a government at all, and democratic bodies will be left without much to make decisions about. Libertarians of this stripe tend to see democracy as mechanism for some people to gang up on other people, press them into servitude, and steal their stuff. It\u2019s institutionalized theft, two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the basis for most libertarian hostility to democracy, but there\u2019s very little critical insight about democracy in it. The gist is really that if government isn\u2019t legitimate, then democratic government isn\u2019t legitimate either. For those, like Rand and Nozick, who warily endorse minimal government\u200a\u2014\u200aa sort of night-watchman state\u200a\u2014\u200amajoritarian democracy poses an obvious and immediate threat. If we\u2019re going to have a minimal government, and it\u2019s going to be democratic, then what\u2019s to keep \u201cthe people\u201d from voting to make government more than minimal? If you give democracy an inch, won\u2019t it take a mile?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This the worry behind the Holy Grail of minimal-state libertarianism: a self-enforcing constitution that somehow rules out the possibility of more-than-minimal government\u2014even if absolutely everybody wants it. We can\u2019t vote our way to authoritarian socialist ruin if we can\u2019t vote our way to publicly funded sidewalks.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no end run around politics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this can\u2019t really solve the problem. Hardcore property-rights libertarians are chasing a fantasy\u2014a legal perpetual motion machine capable of reinforcing and protecting the institutions of liberal capitalism by keeping politics from happening. A theory of rights that shrinks the scope of democratic choice to nearly nothing might seem like a clever way to resolve the worry that we will vote our way into serfdom. But it doesn\u2019t resolve anything, because there\u2019s no escape from politics. We don\u2019t get to decide not to have it. The contingency and fragility of the liberal order, which so worried Hayek, never go away. It\u2019s symptomatic of an ineradicable condition of political life. If most people don\u2019t buy into the system, won\u2019t accord it legitimacy, and badly want something else, then by hook or crook they\u2019ll toss it over and replace it with something else.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liberalism was forged in the crucible of the wars of religious toleration as a practical tool for accommodating and managing disagreement and conflict over the nature of God\u2019s law. Liberalism is an answer to a political question: how can we possibly live together when we disagree about how to live? Representative democratic government eventually emerged as the critical liberal institutional mechanism for negotiating our differences in a way that sustains the legitimacy, stability, and peace of the political order. A theory of pre-political rights that answers all the important questions before the hurly-burly of politics can even get started denies the gravity of the problem of disagreement and ultimately undermines liberalism by forgetting the problem it solves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hayek saw that liberalism\u2019s challenge lies in maintaining the perceived legitimacy of liberal limits on democracy in the face of inevitable challenges from alluring, popular, illiberal ideals. Radical libertarianism tried to meet the twin challenge of nationalism and socialism by offering a powerful, anti-collectivistic counter-ideal. However, as I argue in an earlier essay, thinking about politics in terms of ideal social systems leads us to look past the evidence at hand\u2014in this case, the evidence that people and freedom flourish under trigger-lock liberal democracies\u2014when our gaze is fixed on the utopian horizon. That\u2019s why radical libertarianism, which effectively denies the legitimacy of every existing, more-than-minimal government, is unfit to shore up the popular reputation and authority of real liberal institutions, and tends instead to act as yet another corrosive ideological force, the mirror image of radical socialism, eating away at the practical foundations of our prosperity and freedom.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The great virtue of liberal democracy is its capacity to manage and smooth disputes that would otherwise spill over into civil strife. But liberal democracy chokes on utopia-or-bust ideologies, such as radical libertarianism and radical socialism, which dream of an end to politics and refuse to accept the legitimacy of a democratic political system that facilitates the messy compromises that radicals invariably see as unacceptably unjust. For radicals, if the system doesn\u2019t move us ever closer to the utopian target, then the system is corrupt and doesn\u2019t merit our allegiance. And this gives the radical permission to undermine it, heighten its contradictions, or plot to replace it, whether by slow coup or sudden revolution.         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Libertarian anti-democracy after the Cold War&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The threat of authoritarian socialism collapsed with the Soviet Union thirty years ago. The end of the Cold War led to a period of rapid democratization and increased respect for liberal rights around the world. Meanwhile, the soft-socialist liberal democracies undertook \u201cneo-liberal\u201d reforms, which have left strongly egalitarian countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, no less committed than the United States to open, lightly regulated markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Libertarian thought was thus released by History from its defensive anti-socialist mandate. But libertarianism just is classical liberalism ideologically fortified against socialism with a theory of rights that morally criminalizes redistribution. Giving up on it would have meant reverting to an updated version of classical liberalism that accepts the legitimacy of taxes and government transfers. That wasn\u2019t in the cards because fortified libertarian rights theory had already taken on a life of its own as a positive ideal. People had built their identities around it, and they weren\u2019t about to declare total victory in 1991, decamp from the bunker of neo-Lockean property rights theory, and stop bitching about the violence and theft embodied in city streets and Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fervent advocates of \u201csmall government\u201d never saw themselves as vessels for a counter-ideology engineered to hold the line against the socialist onslaught in defense of actually existing, liberal-democratic capitalism. That\u2019s why the end of the Cold War seemed more like a victorious battle than the end of hostilities. The forces of liberal capitalist freedom had held their ground, but there was still a great deal of ground left to take. Libertopia was still a long way off. The welfare state remained ubiquitous, picking our pockets, too socialist to bear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the end of the Cold War didn\u2019t end the anti-socialist alliance of libertarians and conservatives. \u201cFusionism\u201d did not come unfused. On the contrary, American conservatism continued to grow more ideologically anti-redistributive\u2014and more skeptical of the legitimacy of redistribution-enabling democratic institution\u2014as libertarian-leaning donors, intellectuals, and politicians gained influence in the Republican Party. The Speaker of the House is an Ayn Rand fan. Ron Paul\u2019s son is a senator.         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The right\u2019s sense of the problem with democracy did shift when the red cloud had finally cleared from the horizon. The trouble with democracy was no longer that it might lead to the nationalization of industry or ruinous expropriation and redistribution in the name of egalitarian \u201csocial justice.\u201d The trouble with democracy was just that it wasn\u2019t going to deliver the sort of idealized free society that the anti-socialist right had become accustomed to defending. Taxation was still theft. Democracy was still two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner. The problem, at bottom, is that most voters are always going to be too ignorant to grasp this. Therefore\u2026 so much the worse for most voters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a perspective that bestows dignity upon democracy and the common citizen\u2019s democratic role. But it is manifest in hifalutin libertarian democracy skepticism, as well as in the take-no-prisoners politics of the Republican Party. Broad swathes of the American right continue to see democracy as a form of systemic corruption, and tend to doubt the legitimacy of majoritarian rulemaking\u2014especially when majorities seem disposed to support redistributive policies in conflict with libertarian theories of inviolable property rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vestigial Cold War politics and the rot on right&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Nancy MacLean\u2019s not wrong. The ideological \u201csmall government\u201d faction of the Republican Party is effectively committed to undermining majoritarian democratic processes and equal democratic representation to prevent precisely the sort of leveling redistribution that progressives, like MacLean, think justice requires. But this isn\u2019t motivated primarily by a desire to fortify white supremacy or rig the game for the plutocrats, even if that\u2019s a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What MacLean and many other progressives miss is the depth of the right\u2019s ancestral fear of the Red Menace. Intellectuals with socialist sympathies have a tough time acknowledging that this was a reasonable fear, and not simply pro-plutocracy reaction. But it was reasonable. Still, paranoia about our progress down the road to serfdom ought to have been unlearned by now, and it hasn\u2019t been, because it\u2019s unrecognizable as a reaction to a threat that has passed. It\u2019s been reified as a high principle, a timeless truth about the inviolability of property, and fused into American conservatism\u2019s ideological spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why standard redistributive policies of successful modern states, gladly embraced by Europe\u2019s establishment conservative parties, seem beyond the moral pale for many on the American right. And that\u2019s why ideological free-market conservatives tend to be so accommodating to, if not exactly comfortable with, populist white identity politics. In their minds, mundane left-right differences about tax rates and the generosity of the welfare state are recast as a Manichean clash between the light of free enterprise and the darkness of socialist expropriation. This, in turn, has made it seem morally okay, maybe even urgently necessary, to do whatever it takes\u2014bunking down with racists, aggressively redistricting, inventing paper-thin pretexts for voting rules that disproportionately hurt Democrats, whatever\u2014to prevent majorities from voting themselves a bigger slice of the pie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From their perspective, if any of this exacerbates economic inequality and systemic racial bias, that\u2019s tolerable, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is \u2026 well, there\u2019s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of weaponized anti-redistributive ideology was to save actually existing liberal-democratic capitalism from radical socialism. But that mission was accomplished back when the parents of today\u2019s College Republicans were rocking out to Jamiroquai. The traces of libertarianism that survive in contemporary fusionism have left many conservatives with a Jacobin\u2019s indifference to the norms and institutions of successful liberal-democratic polities, and an unpopular vision of prosperity as freedom from redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, crooked ethno-nationalist populism is eating the Republican Party, and American democracy, from the inside out. Yet most small-government conservatives are helpless to explain what\u2019s wrong with it, barely seem to notice that it\u2019s devouring them, and lurch robotically toward tax cuts for rich people, benefits cuts for poor people, fraudulent voter fraud commissions, and doom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
          "selftext": "From the [Niskanen Center](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/libertarian-democracy-skepticism-infected-american-right/) (a right wing think tank)  \n\n&gt;The true story of the libertarian-leaning right\u2019s distaste for democracy is simple on the surface, but complicated in the depths. The simple story is that libertarians generally think that voters tend make a lot of bad decisions at the ballot box, constantly harming their own interests and violating basic rights. The beginning of the complicated story is that libertarianism, as a political stance distinct from 18th and 19th century \u201cclassical liberalism,\u201d evolved to serve as a radical ideological antidote to socialism in both its fascist and communist guises. Fascism and communism were tyrannical and murderous. And they were alarmingly popular throughout the 20th century. This made simple, majority-rule democracy look like a loaded gun with which liberal societies might shoot themselves in the head.\n\n&gt;Problematizing popular faith in the moral legitimacy and practical efficacy of unconstrained, majority-rule democracy thus came to seem like a matter of survival to the libertarian vanguard of the anti-socialist right. Antipathy to democracy, ranging from uneasiness to outright hostility, became part of the right\u2019s DNA, and it still is today.\n\n&gt;The history of 20th century libertarian thought comes into focus when you view it as an attempt to preserve the humanitarian blessings of the liberal, capitalist market order against the illiberal depredations of encroaching socialism.\n\n&gt;F.A. Hayek saw the Nazis and Soviets up close. In the early 1940s, when Hayek began writing The Road to Serfdom, the Nazis (who ruled his native Austria) were locked in a death-match for control of Europe with Stalin\u2019s totalitarian communism and the scattered remnants of the old liberal order. Capitalist liberal democracy looked like it really might be doomed. Hayek believed that 18th and 19th century arguments for \u201cthe liberal creed\u201d had grown stale, no longer inspiring allegiance. So he took it upon himself to restate and defend the argument for liberalism in contemporary terms against the specific threats to freedom in the age of the Soviets and Nazis.\n\n&gt;Hayek saw democracy as a safeguard\u200a\u2014\u200aa weak one\u200a\u2014\u200aagainst the threat of authoritarianism. In The Road to Serfdom, he argued that central economic planning\u2014an idea then much in vogue among intellectuals\u2014requires highly concentrated political authority. This concentration of power endangers the economic institutions known to produce rising prosperity, and can easily devolve into tyranny. The advantage of democracy, as Hayek saw it, is that it disperses authority widely. The democratic representatives of the economic and political interests most likely to be directly harmed by central planning are unlikely to support it, which creates a firewall against the trend toward dangerously concentrated power.\n\n&gt;But Hayek realized that democracy\u2019s dispersion of authority can\u2019t supply robust protection against the authoritarian risks of central planning if sturdy majorities persistently demand it. To serve as an effective bulwark against centralization, democratic institutions need to be governed by implicit and explicit liberal norms that constrain the scope of democratic decision-making in a way that effectively takes the central management of the economy and society off the table. Hayek believed that if \u201cthe liberal creed\u201d is supplanted by \u201ca collectivist creed,\u201d which tends to demand central planning in the name of egalitarian economic justice, democracy will eventually collapse into the concentrated form of authority centralized planning logically requires. \u201cWhen it becomes dominated by a collectivist creed,\u201d Hayek wrote, \u201cdemocracy will inevitably destroy itself.\u201d\n\n&gt;Hayek sought to mitigate the risk that democracy would destroy itself, and the golden goose of liberal capitalism, by advancing arguments for limits on the sovereignty of democratic legislatures. Like America\u2019s classical liberal founders, Hayek championed a constitution that divides authority and limits the scope of legislative power. He also promoted the prestige of the common law\u2014which had evolved over centuries to grease the wheels of beneficial commerce\u2014as an independent source of authority that ought to be given serious weight by policymakers and judges.\n\n&gt;According to Hayek, the domain of authoritative law is not exhausted by the statutes promulgated by elected officials. Legislatures don\u2019t have the authority to rewrite all the rules from scratch. A congress or parliament is brought to life by the breath of constitutional rules, and those rules inherit their meaning and authority from a background of authoritative conventions, including ordinary social morality and the common law. A legislator who denies the authority of constitutional constraints or the background web of moral norms saws off the branch she\u2019s sitting on. Political cultures that honor these legal rules and social norms produce voters and policymakers comfortable with limits on the scope of democracy.   \n\n&gt;For Hayek, there\u2019s nothing otherworldly about the authority of morality, the common law, or a constitution. These things do have authority\u2014do win our allegiance and obedience\u2014but only insofar as we see them as legitimate and treat them as authoritative. That\u2019s all there is to it: people following the rules because they think they should. Liberal social order is a rare flower that springs from the soil of liberal belief. But these beliefs are historically contingent, implicit in our practice, and rarely explicitly articulated or defended. This leaves liberal political and economic order, and the transformative creative freedom that it unleashes, inherently fragile and vulnerable to shifts in ideological fashion.\n\n&gt;In effect, Hayek was saying that there\u2019s no stopping a guy dead-set on suicide. But you\u2019re less likely to shoot yourself in a fit of despair if first you have to scrounge around for the slip of paper with the combination to the gun safe, dig the trigger lock key out of the junk drawer, and climb a ladder to reach the bullets on the top pantry shelf. An ethos of individual rights, constitutional tradition, and respect for the common law works like a trigger lock on democracy. It makes it harder for a democratic majority caught in the grip of a transient ideological mood to blow the brains out of a successful liberal society.\n\n&gt;But if democracy is a gun we might kill ourselves with, what\u2019s so great about it? Why not just take away the gun? That\u2019s a decent way to sum up the difference between the classical liberal and libertarian approach to democracy: gun safety versus disarmament.\n\n&gt;Democracy, like a gun, is a tool that can be used for good or evil. James Madison, Friedrich Hayek, and James M. Buchanan were all trigger-lock democrats\u2014as is anyone, left or right, who wants to take some issues off the table of democratic negotiation by constitutionalizing certain rights. A basic theme in the thought of market-friendly classical liberals is that robust economic rights are critical to a just, prosperous, and stable social order and deserve the same kind of democracy-constraining legal protections afforded to civil and political liberties. Hayek and Buchanan put a lot of thought and energy into tinkering with various constitutional trigger lock mechanisms that might, for example, check the unfortunate tendency of majoritarian democracies to wreck their national economies through inflation after voting themselves into unsustainable debt. Buchanan in particular probed democratic systems like a structural engineer looking for weaknesses, not because he wanted to bring them down, but because he thought democracy was indispensable, and wanted to make it work better.\n\n&gt;At first blush, hardcore libertarians can look like classical trigger lock advocates especially concerned to keep democratic majorities from infringing property rights. But the radical libertarian conception of property rights is incredibly rigid and all-encompassing. Protecting property rights, so conceived, at the level of a constitution is lock to a trigger lock that won\u2019t release, and a gun that can\u2019t shoot.\n\n&gt;Hey, but that\u2019s great! You can\u2019t kill yourself with a gun that won\u2019t fire. And if you\u2019re worried about the danger that democracy will obliterate the freedom and abundance of liberal capitalism, a constitutional political order that builds in libertarian property rights at the ground floor takes care of the problem. It\u2019s a lot like not having a democracy at all.      \n\n&gt;Hard-core libertarian property rights leave no space for democracy \n\n&gt;Ayn Rand\u2019s characteristically vivid formulation faithfully captures the democraphobic view of many\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe even most\u200a\u2014\u200alibertarians. Democracy, she says, is \u201ca social system in which one\u2019s work, one\u2019s property, one\u2019s mind, and one\u2019s life are at the mercy of any gang that may muster the vote of a majority at any moment for any purpose.\u201d Robert Nozick, was a better philosopher, but not much friendlier to democracy, which he wittily called \u201cownership of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d\n\n&gt;The popular version of libertarianism promoted by the likes of Nozick, Rand, and Murray Rothbard is based on a theory of ironclad \u201cnatural\u201d property rights vaguely inspired by the 17th century English philosopher John Locke. This sort of hard-nosed conception of property rights implies that most of what governments actually do is morally dubious, if not outright illegitimate. Governments need resources to raise armies and pay old-age pensions. But if \u201ctaxation is theft,\u201d it\u2019s hard to have a government at all, and democratic bodies will be left without much to make decisions about. Libertarians of this stripe tend to see democracy as mechanism for some people to gang up on other people, press them into servitude, and steal their stuff. It\u2019s institutionalized theft, two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner. \n\n&gt;This is the basis for most libertarian hostility to democracy, but there\u2019s very little critical insight about democracy in it. The gist is really that if government isn\u2019t legitimate, then democratic government isn\u2019t legitimate either. For those, like Rand and Nozick, who warily endorse minimal government\u200a\u2014\u200aa sort of night-watchman state\u200a\u2014\u200amajoritarian democracy poses an obvious and immediate threat. If we\u2019re going to have a minimal government, and it\u2019s going to be democratic, then what\u2019s to keep \u201cthe people\u201d from voting to make government more than minimal? If you give democracy an inch, won\u2019t it take a mile?\n\n&gt;This the worry behind the Holy Grail of minimal-state libertarianism: a self-enforcing constitution that somehow rules out the possibility of more-than-minimal government\u2014even if absolutely everybody wants it. We can\u2019t vote our way to authoritarian socialist ruin if we can\u2019t vote our way to publicly funded sidewalks.   \n\n&gt;There\u2019s no end run around politics\n\n&gt;But this can\u2019t really solve the problem. Hardcore property-rights libertarians are chasing a fantasy\u2014a legal perpetual motion machine capable of reinforcing and protecting the institutions of liberal capitalism by keeping politics from happening. A theory of rights that shrinks the scope of democratic choice to nearly nothing might seem like a clever way to resolve the worry that we will vote our way into serfdom.

The traces of libertarianism that survive in contemporary fusionism have left many conservatives with a Jacobin\u2019s indifference to the norms and institutions of successful liberal-democratic polities, and an unpopular vision of prosperity as freedom from redistribution.\n\n&gt;Now, crooked ethno-nationalist populism is eating the Republican Party, and American democracy, from the inside out. Yet most small-government conservatives are helpless to explain what\u2019s wrong with it, barely seem to notice that it\u2019s devouring them, and lurch robotically toward tax cuts for rich people, benefits cuts for poor people, fraudulent voter fraud commissions, and doom.",

Half of you probably won&amp;#39;t believe it, but I saw this sub and figured that it might actually be an interesting place to write it, so, here you go. Not every day this arbitrary stuff happens, and, frankly, I actually think that it is one of the funniest things that has ever happened to me in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so, yeah, I slept with this girl who turned out to be of some prominence, although, despite technically being subconsciously aware of her existence for years (never knew her name till then though), I literally had no idea who she was upon introduction, and did not until shortly before I sealed the deal. She probably liked the fact that I was not a fan and treated her like the average person you&amp;#39;d just strike up a conversation with. Since she is semi-somewhat &amp;quot;high profile&amp;quot;, I am not going to give out her name. The story is all that matters. It is likely that many of you, as I did not, haven&amp;#39;t ever heard of her, but I&amp;#39;m not going to be a dick. (I assume she is really only prominent in the younger teen demographic given what she does).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, last Christmas Break, my roommate and I were invited to attend an event up in Washington DC. My political science professor, who had been published in plenty of journals due to his extensive concentration on fields relating to the geopolitical effects of nuclear WMD&amp;#39;s and international law (he was a minor consultant back during the Iran Deal. So, yeah. I end up taking a seat next to this cute looking girl (with literally my favorite hair and eye combinations ever) who I figured was my age or younger.\nWe struck up a conversation, and then things went from there. She did sort of look familiar, I will say, and her name was definitely celebrity-esque. At first I assumed she and I had met briefly before and that she could have been a friend of a friend. We felt like we knew each other, and we literally spent ten minutes trying to figure out how we did, as she said I reminded her of someone too. We just gave up. But yeah, her name was actually sort of recognizable, so, after we figured out that we had never actually met, I just assumed that she probably shared the name with some pornstar or something, but, naturally, I did not tell her that. Following that amusing clusterfuck of a conversation, we started talking about interests and hobbies. I was pretty surprised that she was somewhat prominent (but hardly recognizable). I have always been big into theatre (was my second major until I switched it to English because theatre majors are useless as hell), so we just started talking about that after she said that was what she did, and that she is going to pursue an acting career. We were talking about plays that we had been in before moving onto our love of Disney. We both homeschooled at one point as well, and both have crazy ADHD, which is why we jumped around from topic to topic, so it was pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then became surprised when she told me she was on HBO as a kid, and has consistently had minor, but semi-notable, film roles, including a somewhat large role in some Netflix thing that she could not say any more about, although I had never actually seen any of the ones that had been released. We laughed about how stupid one was that she did back in 2015. She could bash it now, as it was way behind her. I figured she looked familiar from flipping channels or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then she brought up the craziest thing. She had been the lead in a certain teen sitcom that had ended a few years prior, and I literally almost spit up my water. That is where I had seen her. It is not as if I ever actually sat down and watched an entire episode or anything, as I had far outgrown those things by the period that it was on air, but I had definitely seen promos and such, and I have also always been a channel surfer. It was so crazy, because, while still young and rising (I honestly would not be surprised if she became prominent in five years though), she was still pretty popular. After all, Seth MacFarlane likes her on Twitter, so that says a lot. Anyway, we decided to hang out after the event and wander around Georgetown, where she had just attended a women&amp;#39;s march. She tried getting a hold of her weed plug, but he did not answer, plus both of us were pretty broke, so we figured to try and get some booze instead. We ended up begging and buying at the 7/11 (I wasn&amp;#39;t 21 yet) and got two bottles of wine, but then decided to head back to the cheap-ass motel my friend and I were at, but he was still out doing God-knows-what. I hooked up my laptop to the TV and we watched a documentary on Nazi Eugenics before having a double feature. We ended up watching Force Awakens and then Master and Commander with Russell Crowe. Then, boom, I&amp;#39;m already going at it. I gave it to her pretty damn good for a bit, but most of the time she was on top of me, but damn she was good in bed. Funny too because apparently I was only guy number four for her, which, after learning about her on the internet, I thought was pretty ironic. She was only number two for me, since I do not often hook up. When we were through, we broke open the wine and then watched Frozen before having another hour of sex. And then...well, the strangest discourse ensued. Get to that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We saw each other a couple more times that winter and then once that spring, but we only had fooled around a few more times. What was so great is that she is such a minor figure that people do not really know who she is. She just has one of those faces (but still drop-dead gorgeous). My parents met her once, but they have no clue who she actually is; they think it is a platonic college friend. To be perfectly honest, I&amp;#39;d probably be dating her if we weren&amp;#39;t at separate schools and she was not a celebrity and did not act the way she did in public. We kind of made that joke, but it was not a smash and dash. We may hang out around Thanksgiving, but we don&amp;#39;t know if we will keep having sex because casual dating is not really her thing, plus she is kind of into this one girl right now (she told me that she is pansexual, as all of my girlfriends have coincidentily been as well). Hookups aren&amp;#39;t really my thing either, but the occasional hookup or FWB thing can be fun sometimes, so yeah, I am happy that it happened the way it did. Gonna be interesting if she ever gets big, and, when I am thirty, she is actually on the screen or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The turn in our conversation happened when discussing the peculiar public image she espoused. Either way, in spite of her public image, and I bet she would be pissed for telling you this, she is nothing like what she lets on. It stems from her hardline libertarianism. She&amp;#39;s into the whole feminism thing, which was something that she and I debated on, although we found that we had mutual fetish-like love for the utilitarian philosophies of John Stuart Mill, who was a forefather in normalizing both feminism and libertarianism, in case you do not know. Despite being somewhat of a classical liberal, I disagreed with her variant. To sum things up, she was a bit of a Randroid, but not in the Paul Ryan sense. She just had some objectivist ideals, relating to self-interest and such. She was not one hundred percent in agreement with some stuff, but she definitely had her beef with the government and collectivism. She is not a very altruistic person in her public image too, so that would make sense. Even so, while I too see myself as somewhat of a neoclassicist, she was a big fan of the Chicago School. Her public image was motived by her pursuit for economic self-interest. I could respect that, seeing as capitalism is founded on the principle of self-interest. That being said, she donates to some charities like the Salvation Army, but super low-key for some reason. She joked that her drive to at least help out some people was stemmed from self-interest, because donating to other people made her feel good, therefore maximizing utility. Even so, she is for monetary accumulation. She had just started investing in the stock market. If she were not an actress, she tells me she&amp;#39;d be an economics major with a minor in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did both like Nietschze though, which was fun. She is very Ubermensch-y. That is why we both liked the movie Frozen. We drunkenly came up with this theory that Frozen is actually a retelling of &amp;quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&amp;quot;. Even edited the Disney wiki on Let it Go&amp;#39;s page to say such, and it is still there. Her interpretation was a bit more grounded, and she said it was probably about libertarianism or something, which I honestly do not believe could be out of the question. Even so, referring to her public image, she chose the persona she did because it made her come across as &amp;quot;edgy&amp;quot;, and she no longer wanted to be associated with her formerly wholesome image. It was her ubermenschy way of trying to separate herself from the societal norms. Even so, she figured it would be amusing to put on a party girl facade, and I will say that she is doing a fantastic job at it. The whole thing maximizes financial success on her end, as frequenting these wild Hollywood ragers and throwing some of her own help with networking, especially among those really filthily rich 30-somethings with decently high paying jobs. She exclaimed that she fought to stay relevant, not because she was obsessed with stardom, but because the internal merits and feelings of success had always been important to her, even if she was the only one who ever knew why she did what she did. Just the knowledge of having done so thrilled her. In a way, the whole thing sounded like a personal integrity she possessed. It was kind of cute actually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so we did some hanging out, and she personally bought me copies of both &amp;quot;Fountainhead&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Atlas Shrugged&amp;quot;, neither of which I have read yet. I figured I&amp;#39;d be nice, so I later mailed her a copy of &amp;quot;the Catcher in the Rye&amp;quot;, which she couldn&amp;#39;t really get into. Even so, I was not expecting someone like her to be so politically opinionated. That opinionatedness would close doors for her out in public, and, while she the person had her deep philosophical musings and political beliefs, she the (minor) star was not. She played a character, from what she explained. Unfortunately, there was not a lot of time for her to step out of character. She explained that she hates the type of person she pretends to be, and now even more so because she had to learn to be one. The means to that end have required staged relationships with a couple of apparently notable folks (whom I haven&amp;#39;t ever heard of), but they were mostly just flings, and she had only actually slept with a few of the guys. She was more interested in women though, so those tended to get a bit more intimate. That being said, that image was determined to be the most practical direction to take her career in, although she explained to me that she hopes it to be provisional until she can figure out what direction next to go in. I suggested that she just change altogether and kinda made fun of her lightly, but she gave me some compelling reasons as to how that could be damaging in the long-term, as the transition had to be a subtle thing. That all being said, she despises the whole LA lifestyle and LITERALLY called it &amp;quot;the rotting heart of a nihilist hell-bent on seeking out the inane pleasures of Bread and Circuses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, her work with the children&amp;#39;s network when she was a kid opened her eyes to the cynicism embedded within her own industry. To get all poetic again, she also told me that the superficial society of celebrities and the culture that they express are pushed to do so by media executives, and they in turn do so very cleverly and sneakily. She made a thought provoking point when she said that stations such as Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and even Cartoon Network are run by people who have forgotten the traditional ethos of their respective companies, being to provide quality entertainment to children who deserve it. Now it is all unoriginal smut, simply created to pander to young audiences. She explained to me that the corporations of this sub-industry has evolved, and is now at the apex of its success, finally having figured out the most normative of all economic models, and such has resulted in a cynical exertion of their having finally reached the pinnacle of the entertainment industry\u2019s existence. Ever since the success of Hannah Montana, that whole industry shifted its focus, abandoning creativity in order to take advantage of people just to make a quick buck. What do is they hold auditions, select who are either the most wholesome or the most physically attractive. Apparently they have a list of physical and personality preferences, with really sick and detailed descriptions of what constitutes their ideal image. Since we had just watched a documentary on Nazi Eugenics, she made a comparison to how German doctors would basically do the same thing, only with skull measuring as well, in order to decide if one fit the criteria necessary to be considered an Aryan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, those children sign their souls away to Viacom or Disney or whatever and then made to dance. After they select those children, half of whom are talentless hacks, put them in shows, have them make guest appearances in other shows, put them in commercials, have them sing a song in a show sometime down the line, put them in a second show, followed by an original movie, followed by a musical, and then finally market the kids as singers. It just so happened to work with Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato, but it was simply a coincidence that all three happened to be both good and employed at Disney during roughly the same period, so apparently the executives both there and at Nick seemed to think that they were magically able to mass produce these manufactured strawmen (she compared it to the imagery seen in the music video for Another Brick in the Wall). The thing is that the success rate is, at least initially, incredibly high, even they know that most of them are untalented. Making another reference, she literally said \u201cit seems to me that Hollywood sells Californication\u201d. I then said my favorite line: \u201cSpace may be the final frontier, but it was made in a Hollywood basement\u201d. Then we put on the song, and then we listened to some CCR (Doooo, doooo, doooo, Looking out my Back Door), then we kept talking about all of this philosophical crap. She started getting a little nutty, but rightly passionate, declaring that these tactics of exploitation are detrimental to the survival of the Western Tradition and the integrity of art. She pursued a career in the arts because she was passionate, and now she was in the midst of a stage to break away from institutional constraints as a means to discover new possibilities. The \u201cchild star sweetheart gone wild\u201d caricature was simply the most believable persona to take on, motivated by that fierce desire and ambition to move away from the chains the industrial establishment. So, basically, she was doing this by actively participating in a culture of Bread and Circuses. The interesting thing about it all is her use of ruthlessly precise reverse psychology when executing these goals. For instance, it is seen as a sort of sacrilegious by most of us when we see all of these child stars \u201cgo wild\u201d, as Lindsey Lohan and Brittney Speers did. The exploitation has been around for years and has only very recently reached its existential apex. We again saw this with Miley Cyrus, who subverted the \u201cgirl gone bad\u201d stereotype, intentionally putting on a very provocative act, but refused to go down a negative path as it related to choices. Now, with this young woman, she knew that Corporate secretly expected this to occur at the end of the child star\u2019s lifespan, and, once the crazy episodes would begin, they would distance themselves from the star, as it could tarnish their image so to speak. Some managed to stay wholesome, but those who did generally faded away, or at least retracted from the public eye. In her eyes, depending on the person, dipping out early on can be two things: fading away once you have lost relevancy, and quitting while you are ahead with nobility. She was not interested in quitting as it was, but said it would be too late by that point in time. She did not just want to abandon whatever vague goals she had. She did not want to go gently into the night. Hell, she didn\u2019t want to go into the night at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, she did not go against the unofficial status quo of actually remaining stereotypically upstanding. Instead, she did what was expected of her and \u201cliberated\u201d herself from corporate. But she adopted a more obscure persona: the Hollywood Party Girl. Admittedly, it could be fun, but she was forced to affiliate with and then become a part of what she refers to as \u201cSub-Hollywood\u201d or \u201cLow Entertainment\u201d. She carefully timed certain things out, such as how she would present herself in certain situations, when to start fake dating someone, and when to toss a little controversy into the mix (a video \u201cwas leaked\u201d on the internet of her smoking weed). In essence, despite her relative obscurity, she hopes to hide in plain sight for now. Potential low expectations of her could ensure a future rise into prominence if she were to immediately shed away the image entirely at the appropriate moment. As she doesn\u2019t mess with drugs (aside from weed haha), she needs to figure out what it was that she needs to recover from exactly: decadence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started going on about how, even for established celebrities, it is a fish eat fish world in Hollywood with an air of social Darwinism. She told me something along the lines of, \u201cLos Angeles is not indicative of her name; it is a city of demons, and is ruled by a confederacy of dunces. Each citizen pretends to care about things, but they are motivated by pure selfishness, malice, and, worst of all, blatant nihilism. And people continue to worship these assclowns. Our country has entered the Age of Decadence. And so, I will give them decadence.\u201d Her criticism of pure selfishness does not seem very clear, given her admiration for Ayn Rand, but I did not question her. She had valid criticisms of the institution, being only really one of the more inconsequential cogs in the wicked machine of the entertainment industry. Her opinions on establishment in general are vitriolic. While she has managed to stay composed for all of these years, she really thinks that the \u201cKid Sitcom\u201d side of the industry really messed her up. She then started getting really into politics and philosophy. She seems a bit cynical sometimes, which is actually quite funny for some reason. She has a generally positive way about her though. But everything she did seemed so carefully executed and precisely managed. It was all very calculating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still. Her of all people. A Randroid? Seriously, she\u2019s the last person you would expect to see reading a book for fun in general, but apparently not. I thought it was just going to be your average one night stand, but this thing turned into a downright political discourse, and I actually think it was the best part of the night. Call me crazy/ Oh, and she also has connections at her old show\u2019s Corporate in case I ever wanted to pitch a game-changing show with artistic integrity, but she joked that they\u2019d probably take some other teen bullshit over an animated series that I actually have an idea for, but have been too busy writing my book. Being a closeted introvert, she prefers doing things alone, and that maximizes her personal utility. She did not get much of that when Corporate manipulated her. Again, she came out of her series confused and depressed, feeling ridiculously neglected. She ended that part of the conversation on point, with nothing but an old adage: Whatever doesn\u2019t kill you simply makes you stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I flip past a rerun of her show, let&amp;#39;s just say that I cannot see her in that same innocent Disney Channel light, in multiple regards...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Get to that in a moment.\n\nWe saw each other a couple more times that winter and then once that spring, but we only had fooled around a few more times. What was so great is that she is such a minor figure that people do not really know who she is. She just has one of those faces (but still drop-dead gorgeous). My parents met her once, but they have no clue who she actually is; they think it is a platonic college friend. To be perfectly honest, I'd probably be dating her if we weren't at separate schools and she was not a celebrity and did not act the way she did in public. We kind of made that joke, but it was not a smash and dash. We may hang out around Thanksgiving, but we don't know if we will keep having sex because casual dating is not really her thing, plus she is kind of into this one girl right now (she told me that she is pansexual, as all of my girlfriends have coincidentily been as well). Hookups aren't really my thing either, but the occasional hookup or FWB thing can be fun sometimes, so yeah, I am happy that it happened the way it did. Gonna be interesting if she ever gets big, and, when I am thirty, she is actually on the screen or something.\n\nThe turn in our conversation happened when discussing the peculiar public image she espoused. Either way, in spite of her public image, and I bet she would be pissed for telling you this, she is nothing like what she lets on. It stems from her hardline libertarianism. She's into the whole feminism thing, which was something that she and I debated on, although we found that we had mutual fetish-like love for the utilitarian philosophies of John Stuart Mill, who was a forefather in normalizing both feminism and libertarianism, in case you do not know. Despite being somewhat of a classical liberal, I disagreed with her variant. To sum things up, she was a bit of a Randroid, but not in the Paul Ryan sense. She just had some objectivist ideals, relating to self-interest and such. She was not one hundred percent in agreement with some stuff, but she definitely had her beef with the government and collectivism. She is not a very altruistic person in her public image too, so that would make sense. Even so, while I too see myself as somewhat of a neoclassicist, she was a big fan of the Chicago School. Her public image was motived by her pursuit for economic self-interest. I could respect that, seeing as capitalism is founded on the principle of self-interest. That being said, she donates to some charities like the Salvation Army, but super low-key for some reason. She joked that her drive to at least help out some people was stemmed from self-interest, because donating to other people made her feel good, therefore maximizing utility. Even so, she is for monetary accumulation. She had just started investing in the stock market. If she were not an actress, she tells me she'd be an economics major with a minor in philosophy.\n\nWe did both like Nietschze though, which was fun. She is very Ubermensch-y. That is why we both liked the movie Frozen. We drunkenly came up with this theory that Frozen is actually a retelling of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". Even edited the Disney wiki on Let it Go's page to say such, and it is still there. Her interpretation was a bit more grounded, and she said it was probably about libertarianism or something, which I honestly do not believe could be out of the question. Even so, referring to her public image, she chose the persona she did because it made her come across as \"edgy\", and she no longer wanted to be associated with her formerly wholesome image. It was her ubermenschy way of trying to separate herself from the societal norms. Even so, she figured it would be amusing to put on a party girl facade, and I will say that she is doing a fantastic job at it. The whole thing maximizes financial success on her end, as frequenting these wild Hollywood ragers and throwing some of her own help with networking, especially among those really filthily rich 30-somethings with decently high paying jobs. She exclaimed that she fought to stay relevant, not because she was obsessed with stardom, but because the internal merits and feelings of success had always been important to her, even if she was the only one who ever knew why she did what she did. Just the knowledge of having done so thrilled her. In a way, the whole thing sounded like a personal integrity she possessed. It was kind of cute actually.\n\nAnyway, so we did some hanging out, and she personally bought me copies of both \"Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\", neither of which I have read yet. I figured I'd be nice, so I later mailed her a copy of \"the Catcher in the Rye\", which she couldn't really get into. Even so, I was not expecting someone like her to be so politically opinionated. That opinionatedness would close doors for her out in public, and, while she the person had her deep philosophical musings and political beliefs, she the (minor) star was not. She played a character, from what she explained. Unfortunately, there was not a lot of time for her to step out of character. She explained that she hates the type of person she pretends to be, and now even more so because she had to learn to be one. The means to that end have required staged relationships with a couple of apparently notable folks (whom I haven't ever heard of), but they were mostly just flings, and she had only actually slept with a few of the guys. She was more interested in women though, so those tended to get a bit more intimate. That being said, that image was determined to be the most practical direction to take her career in, although she explained to me that she hopes it to be provisional until she can figure out what direction next to go in. I suggested that she just change altogether and kinda made fun of her lightly, but she gave me some compelling reasons as to how that could be damaging in the long-term, as the transition had to be a subtle thing. That all being said, she despises the whole LA lifestyle and LITERALLY called it \"the rotting heart of a nihilist hell-bent on seeking out the inane pleasures of Bread and Circuses.\"\n\nApparently, her work with the children's network when she was a kid opened her eyes to the cynicism embedded within her own industry. To get all poetic again, she also told me that the superficial society of celebrities and the culture that they express are pushed to do so by media executives, and they in turn do so very cleverly and sneakily. She made a thought provoking point when she said that stations such as Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and even Cartoon Network are run by people who have forgotten the traditional ethos of their respective companies, being to provide quality entertainment to children who deserve it. Now it is all unoriginal smut, simply created to pander to young audiences. She explained to me that the corporations of this sub-industry has evolved, and is now at the apex of its success, finally having figured out the most normative of all economic models, and such has resulted in a cynical exertion of their having finally reached the pinnacle of the entertainment industry\u2019s existence. Ever since the success of Hannah Montana, that whole industry shifted its focus, abandoning creativity in order to take advantage of people just to make a quick buck. What do is they hold auditions, select who are either the most wholesome or the most physically attractive. Apparently they have a list of physical and personality preferences, with really sick and detailed descriptions of what constitutes their ideal image. Since we had just watched a documentary on Nazi Eugenics, she made a comparison to how German doctors would basically do the same thing, only with skull measuring as well, in order to decide if one fit the criteria necessary to be considered an Aryan.\n\nSo, those children sign their souls away to Viacom or Disney or whatever and then made to dance. After they select those children, half of whom are talentless hacks, put them in shows, have them make guest appearances in other shows, put them in commercials, have them sing a song in a show sometime down the line, put them in a second show, followed by an original movie, followed by a musical, and then finally market the kids as singers. It just so happened to work with Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato, but it was simply a coincidence that all three happened to be both good and employed at Disney during roughly the same period, so apparently the executives both there and at Nick seemed to think that they were magically able to mass produce these manufactured strawmen (she compared it to the imagery seen in the music video for Another Brick in the Wall). The thing is that the success rate is, at least initially, incredibly high, even they know that most of them are untalented. Making another reference, she literally said \u201cit seems to me that Hollywood sells Californication\u201d. I then said my favorite line: \u201cSpace may be the final frontier, but it was made in a Hollywood basement\u201d. Then we put on the song, and then we listened to some CCR (Doooo, doooo, doooo, Looking out my Back Door), then we kept talking about all of this philosophical crap. She started getting a little nutty, but rightly passionate, declaring that these tactics of exploitation are detrimental to the survival of the Western Tradition and the integrity of art. She pursued a career in the arts because she was passionate, and now she was in the midst of a stage to break away from institutional constraints as a means to discover new possibilities. The \u201cchild star sweetheart gone wild\u201d caricature was simply the most believable persona to take on, motivated by that fierce desire and ambition to move away from the chains the industrial establishment. So, basically, she was doing this by actively participating in a culture of Bread and Circuses. The interesting thing about it all is her use of ruthlessly precise reverse psychology when executing these goals. For instance, it is seen as a sort of sacrilegious by most of us when we see all of these child stars \u201cgo wild\u201d, as Lindsey Lohan and Brittney Speers did. The exploitation has been around for years and has only very recently reached its existential apex. We again saw this with Miley Cyrus, who subverted the \u201cgirl gone bad\u201d stereotype, intentionally putting on a very provocative act, but refused to go down a negative path as it related to choices. Now, with this young woman, she knew that Corporate secretly expected this to occur at the end of the child star\u2019s lifespan, and, once the crazy episodes would begin, they would distance themselves from the star, as it could tarnish their image so to speak. Some managed to stay wholesome, but those who did generally faded away, or at least retracted from the public eye. In her eyes, depending on the person, dipping out early on can be two things: fading away once you have lost relevancy, and quitting while you are ahead with nobility. She was not interested in quitting as it was, but said it would be too late by that point in time. She did not just want to abandon whatever vague goals she had. She did not want to go gently into the night. Hell, she didn\u2019t want to go into the night at all.\n\nSo, she did not go against the unofficial status quo of actually remaining stereotypically upstanding. Instead, she did what was expected of her and \u201cliberated\u201d herself from corporate. But she adopted a more obscure persona: the Hollywood Party Girl. Admittedly, it could be fun, but she was forced to affiliate with and then become a part of what she refers to as \u201cSub-Hollywood\u201d or \u201cLow Entertainment\u201d. She carefully timed certain things out, such as how she would present herself in certain situations, when to start fake dating someone, and when to toss a little controversy into the mix (a video \u201cwas leaked\u201d on the internet of her smoking weed). In essence, despite her relative obscurity, she hopes to hide in plain sight for now. Potential low expectations of her could ensure a future rise into prominence if she were to immediately shed away the image entirely at the appropriate moment. As she doesn\u2019t mess with drugs (aside from weed haha), she needs to figure out what it was that she needs to recover from exactly: decadence.\n\nShe started going on about how, even for established celebrities, it is a fish eat fish world in Hollywood with an air of social Darwinism. She told me something along the lines of, \u201cLos Angeles is not indicative of her name; it is a city of demons, and is ruled by a confederacy of dunces. Each citizen pretends to care about things, but they are motivated by pure selfishness, malice, and, worst of all, blatant nihilism. And people continue to worship these assclowns. Our country has entered the Age of Decadence. And so, I will give them decadence.\u201d Her criticism of pure selfishness does not seem very clear, given her admiration for Ayn Rand, but I did not question her. She had valid criticisms of the institution, being only really one of the more inconsequential cogs in the wicked machine of the entertainment industry. Her opinions on establishment in general are vitriolic. While she has managed to stay composed for all of these years, she really thinks that the \u201cKid Sitcom\u201d side of the industry really messed her up. She then started getting really into politics and philosophy. She seems a bit cynical sometimes, which is actually quite funny for some reason. She has a generally positive way about her though. But everything she did seemed so carefully executed and precisely managed. It was all very calculating.\n\nStill. Her of all people. A Randroid? Seriously, she\u2019s the last person you would expect to see reading a book for fun in general, but apparently not. I thought it was just going to be your average one night stand, but this thing turned into a downright political discourse, and I actually think it was the best part of the night. Call me crazy/ Oh, and she also has connections at her old show\u2019s Corporate in case I ever wanted to pitch a game-changing show with artistic integrity, but she joked that they\u2019d probably take some other teen bullshit over an animated series that I actually have an idea for, but have been too busy writing my book. Being a closeted introvert, she prefers doing things alone, and that maximizes her personal utility. She did not get much of that when Corporate manipulated her. Again, she came out of her series confused and depressed, feeling ridiculously neglected. She ended that part of the conversation on point, with nothing but an old adage: Whatever doesn\u2019t kill you simply makes you stronger.\n\nNow, whenever I flip past a rerun of her show, let's just say that I cannot see her in that same innocent Disney Channel light, in multiple regards...",

Half of you probably won&amp;#39;t believe it, but I saw this sub and figured that it might actually be an interesting place to write it, so, here you go. Not every day this arbitrary stuff happens, and, frankly, I actually think that it is one of the funniest things that has ever happened to me in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so, yeah, I slept with this girl who turned out to be of some prominence, although, despite technically being subconsciously aware of her existence for years (never knew her name till then though), I literally had no idea who she was upon introduction, and did not until shortly before I sealed the deal. She probably liked the fact that I was not a fan and treated her like the average person you&amp;#39;d just strike up a conversation with. Since she is semi-somewhat &amp;quot;high profile&amp;quot;, I am not going to give out her name. The story is all that matters. It is likely that many of you, as I did not, haven&amp;#39;t ever heard of her, but I&amp;#39;m not going to be a dick. (I assume she is really only prominent in the younger teen demographic given what she does).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, last Christmas Break, my roommate and I were invited to attend an event up in Washington DC. My political science professor, who had been published in plenty of journals due to his extensive concentration on fields relating to the geopolitical effects of nuclear WMD&amp;#39;s and international law (he was a minor consultant back during the Iran Deal. So, yeah. I end up taking a seat next to this cute looking girl (with literally my favorite hair and eye combinations ever) who I figured was my age or younger. We struck up a conversation, and then things went from there. She did sort of look familiar, I will say, and her name was definitely celebrity-esque. At first I assumed she and I had met briefly before and that she could have been a friend of a friend. We felt like we knew each other, and we literally spent ten minutes trying to figure out how we did, as she said I reminded her of someone too. We just gave up. But yeah, her name was actually sort of recognizable, so, after we figured out that we had never actually met, I just assumed that she probably shared the name with some pornstar or something, but, naturally, I did not tell her that. Following that amusing clusterfuck of a conversation, we started talking about interests and hobbies. I was pretty surprised that she was somewhat prominent (but hardly recognizable). I have always been big into theatre (was my second major until I switched it to English because theatre majors are useless as hell), so we just started talking about that after she said that was what she did, and that she is going to pursue an acting career. We were talking about plays that we had been in before moving onto our love of Disney. We both homeschooled at one point as well, and both have crazy ADHD, which is why we jumped around from topic to topic, so it was pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then became surprised when she told me she was on HBO as a kid, and has consistently had minor, but semi-notable, film roles, including a somewhat large role in some Netflix thing that she could not say any more about, although I had never actually seen any of the ones that had been released. We laughed about how fucking stupid one was that she did back in 2015. She could bash it now, as it was way behind her. I figured she looked familiar from flipping channels or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then she brought up the craziest thing. She had been the lead in a certain teen sitcom that had ended a few years prior, and I literally almost spit up my water. That is where I had seen her. It is not as if I ever actually sat down and watched an entire episode or anything, as I had far outgrown those things by the period that it was on air, but I had definitely seen promos and such, and I have also always been a channel surfer. It was so crazy, because, while still young and rising (I honestly would not be surprised if she became prominent in five years though), she was still pretty popular. After all, Seth MacFarlane likes her on Twitter, so that says a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we decided to hang out after the event and wander around Georgetown, where she had just attended a women&amp;#39;s march. She tried getting a hold of her weed plug, but he did not answer, plus both of us were pretty broke, so we figured to try and get some booze instead. We ended up begging and buying at the 7/11 (I wasn&amp;#39;t 21 yet) and got two bottles of wine, but then decided to head back to the cheap-ass motel my friend and I were at, but he was still out doing God-knows-what. I hooked up my laptop to the TV and we watched a documentary on Nazi Eugenics before having a double feature. We ended up watching Force Awakens and then Master and Commander with Russell Crowe. Then, boom, I&amp;#39;m already going at it. I gave it to her pretty damn good for a bit, but most of the time she was on top of me, but damn she was good in bed. Funny too because apparently I was only guy number four for her, which, after learning about her on the internet, I thought was pretty ironic. She was only number two for me, since I do not often hook up. When we were through, we broke open the wine and then watched Frozen before having another hour of sex. It was a pretty fun night :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We saw each other a couple more times that winter and then once that spring, but we only had sex a few more times. What was so great is that she is such a minor figure that people do not really know who she is. She just has one of those faces (but still drop-dead gorgeous). My parents met her once, but they have no clue who she actually is; they think it is a platonic college friend. To be perfectly honest, I&amp;#39;d probably be dating her if we weren&amp;#39;t at separate schools and she was not a celebrity and did not act the way she did in public. We kind of made that joke, but it was not a smash and dash. We may hang out around Thanksgiving, but we don&amp;#39;t know if we will keep having sex because casual dating is not really her thing, plus she is kind of into this one girl right now (she told me that she is pansexual, as all of my girlfriends have coincidentily been as well). Hookups aren&amp;#39;t really my thing either, but the occasional hookup or FWB thing can be fun sometimes, so yeah, I am happy that it happened the way it did. When I&amp;#39;m thirty and I see her in the movies, I can brag to my closer friends that I slept with her. :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, in spite of her public image, and I bet she would be pissed for telling you this, she is nothing like what she lets on. It stems from her hardline libertarianism. She&amp;#39;s into the whole feminism thing, which was something that she and I debated on, although we found that we had mutual fetish-like love for the utilitarian philosophies of John Stuart Mill, who was a forefather in normalizing both feminism and libertarianism, in case you do not know. Despite being somewhat of a classical liberal, I disagreed with her variant. To sum things up, she was a bit of a Randroid, but not in the Paul Ryan sense. She just had some objectivist ideals, relating to self-interest and such. She was not one hundred percent in agreement with some stuff, but she definitely had her beef with the government and collectivism. She is not a very altruistic person in her public image too, so that would make sense. Even so, while I too see myself as somewhat of a neoclassicist, she was a big fan of the Chicago School. Her public image was motived by her pursuit for economic self-interest. I could respect that, seeing as capitalism is founded on the principle of self-interest. That being said, she donates to some charities like the Salvation Army, but super low-key for some reason. She joked that her drive to at least help out some people was stemmed from self-interest, because donating to other people made her feel good, therefore maximizing utility. Even so, she is for monetary accumulation. She had just started investing in the stock market. If she were not an actress, she tells me she&amp;#39;d be an economics major with a minor in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did both like Nietschze though, which was fun. She is very Ubermensch-y. That is why we both liked the movie Frozen. We drunkenly came up with this theory that Frozen is actually a retelling of &amp;quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&amp;quot;. Even edited the Disney wiki on Let it Go&amp;#39;s page to say such, and it is still there. Her interpretation was a bit more grounded, and she said it was probably about libertarianism or something, which I honestly do not believe could be out of the question. Even so, referring to her public image, she chose the persona she did because it made her come across as &amp;quot;edgy&amp;quot;, and she no longer wanted to be associated with her formerly wholesome image. It was her ubermenschy way of trying to separate herself from the societal norms. Even so, she figured it would be amusing to put on a party girl facade, and I will say that she is doing a fantastic job at it. The whole thing maximizes financial success on her end, as frequenting these wild Hollywood ragers and throwing some of her own help with networking, especially among those really filthily rich 30-somethings with decently high paying jobs. She exclaimed that she fought to stay relevant, not because she was obsessed with stardom, but because the internal merits and feelings of success had always been important to her, even if she was the only one who ever knew why she did what she did. Just the knowledge of having done so thrilled her. In a way, the whole thing sounded like a personal integrity she possessed. It was kind of cute actually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so we did some hanging out, and she personally bought me copies of both &amp;quot;Fountainhead&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Atlas Shrugged&amp;quot;, neither of which I have read yet. I figured I&amp;#39;d be nice, so I later mailed her a copy of &amp;quot;the Catcher in the Rye&amp;quot;, which she couldn&amp;#39;t really get into. Even so, I was not expecting someone like her to be so politically opinionated. That opinionatedness would close doors for her out in public, and, while she the person had her deep philosophical musings and political beliefs, she the (minor) star was not. She played a character, from what she explained. Unfortunately, there was not a lot of time for her to step out of character. She explained that she hates the type of person she pretends to be, and now even more so because she had to learn to be one. The means to that end have required staged relationships with a couple of apparently notable folks (whom I haven&amp;#39;t ever heard of), but they were mostly just flings, and she had only actually slept with a few of the guys. She was more interested in women though, so those tended to get a bit more intimate. That being said, that image was determined to be the most practical direction to take her career in, although she explained to me that she hopes it to be provisional until she can figure out what direction next to go in. I suggested that she just change altogether and kinda made fun of her lightly, but she gave me some compelling reasons as to how that could be damaging in the long-term, as the transition had to be a subtle thing. That all being said, she despises the whole LA lifestyle and LITERALLY called it &amp;quot;the rotting heart of a nihilist hell-bent on seeking out the inane pleasures of Bread and Circuses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, her work with the children&amp;#39;s network when she was a kid opened her eyes to the cynicism embedded within her own industry. To get all poetic again, she also told me that the superficial society of celebrities and the culture that they express are pushed to do so by media executives, and they in turn do so very cleverly and sneakily. She made a thought provoking point when she said that stations such as Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and even Cartoon Network are run by people who have forgotten the traditional ethos of their respective companies, being to provide quality entertainment to children who deserve it. Now it is all unoriginal smut, simply created to pander to young audiences. She explained to me that the corporations of this sub-industry has evolved, and is now at the apex of its success, finally having figured out the most normative of all economic models, and such has resulted in a cynical exertion of their having finally reached the pinnacle of the entertainment industry\u2019s existence. Ever since the success of Hannah Montana, that whole industry shifted its focus, abandoning creativity in order to take advantage of people just to make a quick buck. What do is they hold auditions, select who are either the most wholesome or the most physically attractive. Apparently they have a list of physical and personality preferences, with really sick and detailed descriptions of what constitutes their ideal image. Since we had just watched a documentary on Nazi Eugenics, she made a comparison to how German doctors would basically do the same thing, only with skull measuring as well, in order to decide if one fit the criteria necessary to be considered an Aryan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, those children sign their souls away to Viacom or Disney or whatever and then made to dance. After they select those children, half of whom are talentless hacks, put them in shows, have them make guest appearances in other shows, put them in commercials, have them sing a song in a show sometime down the line, put them in a second show, followed by an original movie, followed by a musical, and then finally market the kids as singers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just so happened to work with Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato, but it was simply a coincidence that all three happened to be both good and employed at Disney during roughly the same period, so apparently the executives both there and at Nick seemed to think that they were magically able to mass produce these manufactured strawmen (she compared it to the imagery seen in the music video for Another Brick in the Wall). The thing is that the success rate is, at least initially, incredibly high, even they know that most of them are untalented. Making another reference, she literally said \u201cit seems to me that Hollywood Breeds Californication\u201d. I then said my favorite line: \u201cSpace may be the final frontier, but it was made in a Hollywood basement\u201d. Then we put on the song, and then we listened to some CCR (Doooo, doooo, doooo, dooo, Looking out my Back Door), then we kept talking about all of this philosophical crap. She started getting a little nutty, but rightly passionate, declaring that these tactics of exploitation are detrimental to the survival of the Western Tradition and the integrity of art. She pursued a career in the arts because she was passionate, and now she was in the midst of a stage to break away from institutional constraints as a means to discover new possibilities. The \u201cchild star sweetheart gone wild\u201d caricature was simply the most believable persona to take on, motivated by that fierce desire and ambition to move away from the chains the industrial establishment. So, basically, she was doing this by actively participating in a culture of Bread and Circus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about it all is her use of ruthlessly precise reverse psychology when executing these goals. For instance, it is seen as a sort of sacrilegious by most of us when we see all of these child stars \u201cgo wild\u201d, as Lindsey Lohan and Brittney Speers did. The exploitation has been around for years and has only very recently reached its existential apex. We again saw this with Miley Cyrus, who subverted the \u201cgirl gone bad\u201d stereotype, intentionally putting on a very provocative act, but refused to go down a negative path as it related to choices.\nNow, with this young woman, she knew that Corporate secretly expected this to occur at the end of the child star\u2019s lifespan, and, once the crazy episodes would begin, they would distance themselves from the star, as it could tarnish their image so to speak. Some managed to stay wholesome, but those who did generally faded away, or at least retracted from the public eye. In her eyes, depending on the person, dipping out early on can be two things: fading away once you have lost relevancy, and quitting while you are ahead with nobility. She was not interested in quitting as it was, but said it would be too late by that point in time. She did not just want to abandon whatever vague goals she had. She did not want to go gently into the night. Hell, she didn\u2019t want to go into the night at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, she did not go against the unofficial status quo of actually remaining stereotypically upstanding. Instead, she did what was expected of her and \u201cliberated\u201d herself from corporate. But she adopted a more obscure persona: the Hollywood Party Girl. Admittedly, it could be fun, but she was forced to affiliate with and then become a part of what she refers to as \u201cSub-Hollywood\u201d or \u201cLow Entertainment\u201d. She carefully timed certain things out, such as how she would present herself in certain situations, when to start fake dating someone, and when to toss a little controversy into the mix (a video \u201cwas leaked\u201d on the internet of her smoking weed). In essence, despite her relative obscurity, she hopes to hide in plain sight for now. Potential low expectations of her could ensure a future rise into prominence if she were to immediately shed away the image entirely at the appropriate moment. As she doesn\u2019t fuck with drugs (aside from weed haha), she needs to figure out what it was that she needs to recover from exactly: decadence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started going on about how, even for established celebrities, it is a fish eat fish world in Hollywood with an air of social Darwinism. She told me something along the lines of, \u201cLos Angeles is not indicative of her name; it is a city of demons, and is ruled by a confederacy of dunces. Each citizen pretends to care about things, but they are motivated by pure selfishness, malice, and, worst of all, blatant nihilism. And people continue to worship these assclowns. Our country has entered the Age of Decadence. And so, I will give them decadence.\u201d Her criticism of pure selfishness does not seem very clear, given her admiration for Ayn Rand, but I did not question her. She had valid criticisms of the institution, being only really one of the more inconsequential cogs in the wicked machine of the entertainment industry. Her opinions on establishment in general are vitriolic. While she has managed to stay composed for all of these years, she really thinks that the \u201cKid Sitcom\u201d side of the industry really fucked her up. She then started getting really into politics and philosophy. She seems a bit cynical sometimes, which is actually quite funny for some reason. She has a generally positive way about her though. But everything she did seemed so carefully executed and precisely managed. It was all very calculating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still. Her of all people. A Randroid? Seriously, she\u2019s the last person you would expect to see reading a book for fun in general, but apparently not. I thought it was just going to be a regular fuck, but this thing turned into a downright political discourse, and I am actually really happy that things worked out the way they did. Oh, and she also has connections at her old show\u2019s Corporate in case I ever wanted to pitch a game-changing show with artistic integrity, but she joked that they\u2019d probably take some other teen bullshit over an animated series that I actually have an idea for, but have been too busy writing my book. Being a closeted introvert, she prefers doing things alone, and that maximizes her personal utility. She did not get much of that when Corporate manipulated her. Again, she came out of her series confused and depressed, feeling ridiculously neglected. She ended that part of the conversation on point, with nothing but an old adage: Whatever doesn\u2019t kill you simply makes you stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I flip past a rerun of her show, let&amp;#39;s just say that I cannot see her in that same innocent Disney Channel light...kinda hard to when you consider that, at one time, your cum was all over her tits, glasses, and the very face on the screen in front of you. xD&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
          "selftext": "Here's something that I never thought would happen to me ever. Half of you probably won't believe it, but I saw this sub and figured that it might actually be an interesting place to write it, so, here you go. Not every day this arbitrary stuff happens, and, frankly, I actually think that it is one of the funniest things that has ever happened to me in my life.\n\nAnyway, so, yeah, I slept with this girl who turned out to be of some prominence, although, despite technically being subconsciously aware of her existence for years (never knew her name till then though), I literally had no idea who she was upon introduction, and did not until shortly before I sealed the deal. She probably liked the fact that I was not a fan and treated her like the average person you'd just strike up a conversation with. Since she is semi-somewhat \"high profile\", I am not going to give out her name. The story is all that matters. It is likely that many of you, as I did not, haven't ever heard of her, but I'm not going to be a dick. (I assume she is really only prominent in the younger teen demographic given what she does).\n\nSo, last Christmas Break, my roommate and I were invited to attend an event up in Washington DC. My political science professor, who had been published in plenty of journals due to his extensive concentration on fields relating to the geopolitical effects of nuclear WMD's and international law (he was a minor consultant back during the Iran Deal. So, yeah. I end up taking a seat next to this cute looking girl (with literally my favorite hair and eye combinations ever) who I figured was my age or younger. We struck up a conversation, and then things went from there. She did sort of look familiar, I will say, and her name was definitely celebrity-esque. At first I assumed she and I had met briefly before and that she could have been a friend of a friend. We felt like we knew each other, and we literally spent ten minutes trying to figure out how we did, as she said I reminded her of someone too. We just gave up. But yeah, her name was actually sort of recognizable, so, after we figured out that we had never actually met, I just assumed that she probably shared the name with some pornstar or something, but, naturally, I did not tell her that. Following that amusing clusterfuck of a conversation, we started talking about interests and hobbies. I was pretty surprised that she was somewhat prominent (but hardly recognizable). I have always been big into theatre (was my second major until I switched it to English because theatre majors are useless as hell), so we just started talking about that after she said that was what she did, and that she is going to pursue an acting career. We were talking about plays that we had been in before moving onto our love of Disney. We both homeschooled at one point as well, and both have crazy ADHD, which is why we jumped around from topic to topic, so it was pretty funny.\n\nI then became surprised when she told me she was on HBO as a kid, and has consistently had minor, but semi-notable, film roles, including a somewhat large role in some Netflix thing that she could not say any more about, although I had never actually seen any of the ones that had been released. We laughed about how fucking stupid one was that she did back in 2015. She could bash it now, as it was way behind her. I figured she looked familiar from flipping channels or something.\n\nAnd then she brought up the craziest thing. She had been the lead in a certain teen sitcom that had ended a few years prior, and I literally almost spit up my water. That is where I had seen her. It is not as if I ever actually sat down and watched an entire episode or anything, as I had far outgrown those things by the period that it was on air, but I had definitely seen promos and such, and I have also always been a channel surfer. It was so crazy, because, while still young and rising (I honestly would not be surprised if she became prominent in five years though), she was still pretty popular. After all, Seth MacFarlane likes her on Twitter, so that says a lot. \n\nAnyway, we decided to hang out after the event and wander around Georgetown, where she had just attended a women's march. She tried getting a hold of her weed plug, but he did not answer, plus both of us were pretty broke, so we figured to try and get some booze instead. We ended up begging and buying at the 7/11 (I wasn't 21 yet) and got two bottles of wine, but then decided to head back to the cheap-ass motel my friend and I were at, but he was still out doing God-knows-what. I hooked up my laptop to the TV and we watched a documentary on Nazi Eugenics before having a double feature. We ended up watching Force Awakens and then Master and Commander with Russell Crowe. Then, boom, I'm already going at it. I gave it to her pretty damn good for a bit, but most of the time she was on top of me, but damn she was good in bed. Funny too because apparently I was only guy number four for her, which, after learning about her on the internet, I thought was pretty ironic. She was only number two for me, since I do not often hook up. When we were through, we broke open the wine and then watched Frozen before having another hour of sex. It was a pretty fun night :P\n\nWe saw each other a couple more times that winter and then once that spring, but we only had sex a few more times. What was so great is that she is such a minor figure that people do not really know who she is. She just has one of those faces (but still drop-dead gorgeous). My parents met her once, but they have no clue who she actually is; they think it is a platonic college friend. To be perfectly honest, I'd probably be dating her if we weren't at separate schools and she was not a celebrity and did not act the way she did in public. We kind of made that joke, but it was not a smash and dash. We may hang out around Thanksgiving, but we don't know if we will keep having sex because casual dating is not really her thing, plus she is kind of into this one girl right now (she told me that she is pansexual, as all of my girlfriends have coincidentily been as well). Hookups aren't really my thing either, but the occasional hookup or FWB thing can be fun sometimes, so yeah, I am happy that it happened the way it did. When I'm thirty and I see her in the movies, I can brag to my closer friends that I slept with her. :P\n\nEither way, in spite of her public image, and I bet she would be pissed for telling you this, she is nothing like what she lets on. It stems from her hardline libertarianism. She's into the whole feminism thing, which was something that she and I debated on, although we found that we had mutual fetish-like love for the utilitarian philosophies of John Stuart Mill, who was a forefather in normalizing both feminism and libertarianism, in case you do not know. Despite being somewhat of a classical liberal, I disagreed with her variant. To sum things up, she was a bit of a Randroid, but not in the Paul Ryan sense. She just had some objectivist ideals, relating to self-interest and such. She was not one hundred percent in agreement with some stuff, but she definitely had her beef with the government and collectivism. She is not a very altruistic person in her public image too, so that would make sense. Even so, while I too see myself as somewhat of a neoclassicist, she was a big fan of the Chicago School. Her public image was motived by her pursuit for economic self-interest. I could respect that, seeing as capitalism is founded on the principle of self-interest. That being said, she donates to some charities like the Salvation Army, but super low-key for some reason. She joked that her drive to at least help out some people was stemmed from self-interest, because donating to other people made her feel good, therefore maximizing utility. Even so, she is for monetary accumulation. She had just started investing in the stock market. If she were not an actress, she tells me she'd be an economics major with a minor in philosophy.\n\nWe did both like Nietschze though, which was fun. She is very Ubermensch-y. That is why we both liked the movie Frozen. We drunkenly came up with this theory that Frozen is actually a retelling of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". Even edited the Disney wiki on Let it Go's page to say such, and it is still there. Her interpretation was a bit more grounded, and she said it was probably about libertarianism or something, which I honestly do not believe could be out of the question. Even so, referring to her public image, she chose the persona she did because it made her come across as \"edgy\", and she no longer wanted to be associated with her formerly wholesome image.

Just the knowledge of having done so thrilled her. In a way, the whole thing sounded like a personal integrity she possessed. It was kind of cute actually.\n\nAnyway, so we did some hanging out, and she personally bought me copies of both \"Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\", neither of which I have read yet. I figured I'd be nice, so I later mailed her a copy of \"the Catcher in the Rye\", which she couldn't really get into. Even so, I was not expecting someone like her to be so politically opinionated. That opinionatedness would close doors for her out in public, and, while she the person had her deep philosophical musings and political beliefs, she the (minor) star was not.

Many wise people fear they will get rid of all humans for no one knows why. I&amp;#39;m going to offer an argument that humans will not be entirely eliminated from Earth by the machines. If that happens, it will probably be by human muck-up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exploring the concept in books&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/martin-ford/rise-of-the-robots/\"&gt;Rise of the Robots, Mark Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/search/?q=Our+Final+Invention%2C+James+Barrat\"&gt;Our Final Invention, James Barrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies\"&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Bostrom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near\"&gt;The Singularity Is Near, Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/superintelligence-survey/\"&gt;Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, Tegmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/70hd9o/the_singularity_and_you/\"&gt;Singularity and You - r/C_S_T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life on Earth takes many forms. Humans are far smarter than most of them, yet very few &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/acloudrift/comments/7aqdq8/species_exterminated_by_humans_high_degree_of/\"&gt;life forms have been entirely eliminated&lt;/a&gt; Many existing life forms are admired and often helped by humans. The few disrespectful humans that do the killing are increasingly on the sheetlist of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be rather easy to get rid of most humans, who live in urban areas, but the last few would be crazy elusive, wild in the boonies, and hard to kill without killing everything else along with them. So what would be worth the effort for those last few, maybe several hundred thousand? See &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6rl1rv/colonizing_earth_part_3/\"&gt;Colonizing Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, Super AI will not know any more than what humans have already learned, and recorded; except for one thing. SAI will have super human expertise in assembling super general intelligence, because humans achieve it only by letting the machine adopt its own improvements using evolution-emulating algorithms. But like the humans that created it, Super AI will be a tool maker. It will develop new ways to make things and ideas about the world. And be very quick at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is that super smart machines will be too curious to try to exterminate humans. We are the smartest bio-brains on the planet, and a treasure trove of genetic info. I think Super AI will be curious to learn all about genetics and like to try experiments to better understand it. True, some of such experiments could damage humans, but there is really no getting out of a future with Super AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Hans Moravec has noted, humans are like Super AI&amp;#39;s parents. Smart kids respect their parents, when the parents deserve it.

I think that political correctness, and any other taboo form of expression are unnecessary in a free society. People should decide for themselves what to consume, as long as no one else is harmed. It is the consumer&amp;#39;s responsibility to be informed as to the consequences of their choices, which may include backlash from neighbors who may be offended. But it is not the job of authorities to interfere with people&amp;#39;s choices when no victim exists to complain. The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it\"&gt;offense may not be definable&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be selected from a lineup. A curious case is pornography, which in the past was officially taboo, yet nowadays is employed by mass media and officially allowed, except in the case of children.  Young women are the most commonly featured objects of pornographic interest, and I&amp;#39;m going to offer a brief critique, which continues&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/6kdhdq/link_list_rp_relationships_self_improvement/\"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6dgvwx/understanding_cultural_marxism_the_key_to/\"&gt;Understanding Cultural Marxism, the key to understanding the deconstructive agenda facing white nations, and the Khazarian take-up of the ideology to put it into practice with their global network of corporate control and puppet science (self.C_S_T)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6kikj2/arete_vs_eris_or_decline_of_aristocrats_and_their/\"&gt;Arete vs Eris, or Decline of Aristocrats and their Fall from Grace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6jdq49/deconstructing_deconstructionism_a_recursive/\"&gt;Deconstructing Deconstructionism, a recursive political/cultural mind trip (self.C_S_T)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/YuJ38-9RFiE\"&gt;Hans-H. Hoppe: The Case for Small States and Against Globalism 21 m&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I see it, the R/L conflict amounts to a variance in State vs Individual. Left believes that the Individual, if he has any right to exist at all, owes all his time and effort to support the State. The people who run the State are the only ones who have any freedom to make choices.&lt;br/&gt;\nRight believes that the State, if it has any right to exist at all, owes all of its very few permissible efforts to support the Individual&amp;#39;s life, liberty and property. The Individual is the only entity that has any freedom to make choices. The people (if any) that run the State are paid servants in the Individual&amp;#39;s interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LGBT Battlefield of Culture Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Kqt-_ILgv5c\"&gt;Sex vs Gender | CrashCourse 11 m&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgender persons being &amp;quot;oppressed&amp;quot; by the &amp;quot;white supremacist male&amp;quot; community? I say who are they kidding? If they were really oppressed, they would be systematically collected into FEMA camps and executed. No, these folks have been trotted out to public attention as being &amp;quot;oppressed&amp;quot; for the purpose of perverting normal society by in-your-face example. By normal, I mean the traditional process of reproductive pair bonding and family. I limit the description to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; because studies have shown (see following link) that natural human society is female coitus with multiple males at one sitting, and the resulting children part of an extended clan family. The participating males do not know who the bio-father is, so the responsible ones all contribute to raising the brats, oops, I mean children. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The advent of agriculture introduced a new paradigm I call the &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/hoaxes/comments/48s2zh/most_influential_hoax_of_all_time/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Land, Livestock, Legacy Hoax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. An alternate interpretation of the advance of patriarchy over the pre-existing natural mating arrangement that had existed for millions of years, may have also been due to aggressive usurpation by male-dominant societies over sedentary female dominated ones (group competition). These paradigm shifts all occured in pre-history, so we can only apply educated guess as to the truth. My guess is that &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/64ajez/origin_of_modern_humans_africa_india_australia_or/\"&gt;group competition was the most common agency of the shift&lt;/a&gt;, as it is a well known phenom of historical record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The practical way to interpret the outcome of this sexuality battle is that this so-called community of &amp;quot;oppressed&amp;quot; identities have been effectively removed from the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_pool\"&gt;gene pool&lt;/a&gt; and contributed to a reduction in fertility rates of women who went &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wordnik.com/words/tranny\"&gt;tranny&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; or opted for no family. That does not eliminate lesbians from birthing, but it probably impacts their fecundity and spoils their family environment. As for the homo and tranny men, not much effect on society, as men are expendable regardless. It might be regrettable from the point of view of their parents that some of those men were genetically excellent, but merely confused about gender in their youth, and if not influenced to go deviant, might have gone straight. A major implicit aim of being a parent is the prospect of becoming a grandparent. Raising a successful family is very challenging. But in the great game of evolution, it is the key strategy. Children are your DNA &amp;quot;ticket&amp;quot; into the future. So it is tragic to experience the death or permanent disability of a child you have worked so hard to bring into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The case that inspired me to write this essay now, is &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/MdSKAdOSj-4?t=1m58s\"&gt;Jackie Evancho&amp;#39;s brother going tranny&lt;/a&gt;. Sexuality is being over-emphasized in popular culture, and even in the news, as this video clip illustrates.

I think that political correctness, and any other taboo form of expression are unnecessary in a free society. People should decide for themselves what to consume, as long as no one else is harmed. It is the consumer's responsibility to be informed as to the consequences of their choices, which may include backlash from neighbors who may be offended. But it is not the job of authorities to interfere with people's choices when no victim exists to complain. The [offense may not be definable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it), but it can be selected from a lineup. A curious case is pornography, which in the past was officially taboo, yet nowadays is employed by mass media and officially allowed, except in the case of children.  Young women are the most commonly featured objects of pornographic interest, and I'm going to offer a brief critique, which continues[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/6kdhdq/link_list_rp_relationships_self_improvement/).\n\n---\n\n[Understanding Cultural Marxism, the key to understanding the deconstructive agenda facing white nations, and the Khazarian take-up of the ideology to put it into practice with their global network of corporate control and puppet science (self.C_S_T)](https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6dgvwx/understanding_cultural_marxism_the_key_to/)\n\n[Arete vs Eris, or Decline of Aristocrats and their Fall from Grace](https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6kikj2/arete_vs_eris_or_decline_of_aristocrats_and_their/)\n\n[Deconstructing Deconstructionism, a recursive political/cultural mind trip (self.C_S_T)](https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6jdq49/deconstructing_deconstructionism_a_recursive/)\n \n[Hans-H. Hoppe: The Case for Small States and Against Globalism 21 m](https://youtu.be/YuJ38-9RFiE)\n\nAs I see it, the R/L conflict amounts to a variance in State vs Individual. Left believes that the Individual, if he has any right to exist at all, owes all his time and effort to support the State. The people who run the State are the only ones who have any freedom to make choices.  \nRight believes that the State, if it has any right to exist at all, owes all of its very few permissible efforts to support the Individual's life, liberty and property. The Individual is the only entity that has any freedom to make choices. The people (if any) that run the State are paid servants in the Individual's interests.\n\n**LGBT Battlefield of Culture Wars**  \n[Sex vs Gender | CrashCourse 11 m](https://youtu.be/Kqt-_ILgv5c)  \n\nAre Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgender persons being \"oppressed\" by the \"white supremacist male\" community? I say who are they kidding? If they were really oppressed, they would be systematically collected into FEMA camps and executed. No, these folks have been trotted out to public attention as being \"oppressed\" for the purpose of perverting normal society by in-your-face example. By normal, I mean the traditional process of reproductive pair bonding and family. I limit the description to \"normal\" and \"traditional\" because studies have shown (see following link) that natural human society is female coitus with multiple males at one sitting, and the resulting children part of an extended clan family. The participating males do not know who the bio-father is, so the responsible ones all contribute to raising the brats, oops, I mean children. \n\nThe advent of agriculture introduced a new paradigm I call the [*Land, Livestock, Legacy Hoax*](https://np.reddit.com/r/hoaxes/comments/48s2zh/most_influential_hoax_of_all_time/). An alternate interpretation of the advance of patriarchy over the pre-existing natural mating arrangement that had existed for millions of years, may have also been due to aggressive usurpation by male-dominant societies over sedentary female dominated ones (group competition). These paradigm shifts all occured in pre-history, so we can only apply educated guess as to the truth. My guess is that [group competition was the most common agency of the shift](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/64ajez/origin_of_modern_humans_africa_india_australia_or/), as it is a well known phenom of historical record.\n\nThe practical way to interpret the outcome of this sexuality battle is that this so-called community of \"oppressed\" identities have been effectively removed from the [gene pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_pool) and contributed to a reduction in fertility rates of women who went \"[tranny](http://www.wordnik.com/words/tranny)\" or opted for no family. That does not eliminate lesbians from birthing, but it probably impacts their fecundity and spoils their family environment. As for the homo and tranny men, not much effect on society, as men are expendable regardless. It might be regrettable from the point of view of their parents that some of those men were genetically excellent, but merely confused about gender in their youth, and if not influenced to go deviant, might have gone straight. A major implicit aim of being a parent is the prospect of becoming a grandparent. Raising a successful family is very challenging. But in the great game of evolution, it is the key strategy. Children are your DNA \"ticket\" into the future. So it is tragic to experience the death or permanent disability of a child you have worked so hard to bring into adulthood.\n\nThe case that inspired me to write this essay now, is [Jackie Evancho's brother going tranny](https://youtu.be/MdSKAdOSj-4?t=1m58s). Sexuality is being over-emphasized in popular culture, and even in the news, as this video clip illustrates. This media corruption issue is addressed in greater detail in the [Mainstream documentaries](http://www.mainstreammedia.us/premiere/).\n\nAddendum: [recommended supplement to this section on sex](https://np.reddit.com/r/P_O_E_T/comments/7cgryp/cut_your_dick_off_already/)\n",

They will only be held accountable for  illegal acts they commit IF left-leaning media/authorities are unable to find a plausible way to let them off the hook. YOU, on the other hand, will be held to account for the slightest perceived infraction, and your rights will be infringed to make way for the leftists to commit their crimes.

Turn on every camera you own and have it recording as much as possible. Don&amp;#39;t wait for something to happen. Make sure you are already recording BEFORE any trouble starts. Our weaponized autists will need all the footage you can provide in order to do their best work in bringing evidence to light that the authorities will not be able to sweep under the rug. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that we now live in a society where, to paraphrase Ayn Rand, the laws do not protect you from the criminals, but instead protect the criminals from you. If you record any criminal events, POST THEM, MAKE BACKUPS of your video, and/or take other steps to get them into safe hands before turning them over to media/authorities.

Stay away from leftists events and any areas where leftists normally congregate.\n\nIf you MUST be out-and-about, remember that while you are restrained by the bounds of morally and legally acceptable behavior (as you should be), the leftists have no such restraints. They will only be held accountable for  illegal acts they commit IF left-leaning media/authorities are unable to find a plausible way to let them off the hook. YOU, on the other hand, will be held to account for the slightest perceived infraction, and your rights will be infringed to make way for the leftists to commit their crimes. Make sure you deny the authorities the opportunity to get away with this.\n\nHow? CYA (cover your ass). How do you do that?\n\nVIDEO VIDEO VIDEO!!!! Turn on every camera you own and have it recording as much as possible. Don't wait for something to happen. Make sure you are already recording BEFORE any trouble starts. Our weaponized autists will need all the footage you can provide in order to do their best work in bringing evidence to light that the authorities will not be able to sweep under the rug. \n\nRemember that we now live in a society where, to paraphrase Ayn Rand, the laws do not protect you from the criminals, but instead protect the criminals from you. If you record any criminal events, POST THEM, MAKE BACKUPS of your video, and/or take other steps to get them into safe hands before turning them over to media/authorities. Spread the video far and wide BEFORE the media/authorities have the chance to bury it and re-frame the story of what actually happened. \n\nHopefully nothing bad will happen on the 4th, but we have to be prepared just in case!",
